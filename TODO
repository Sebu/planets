DONE
- sphere1: light color
- different planet value from file
- remove blue overlapped arc
- rangeinput -> hit return
- sun/moon
- radius of sun (darken planets)
- fix rotationArcs

TODO
- EMAIL new version
- moon speed functions days per year
- move moon to normal planet models :)
- camera fix :/
- memory leak :/ in curve code ( destroy geometry )
- generate menu
- more lambda :D
- variable slider max ( depended on model )


Titles:
Sphere 1-2 (obliquity of ecliptic)
Sphere 2-3 (right angle)
Sphere 3-4 (unknown)


Sphere Period (days)
Sphere 1 (daily)
Sphere 2 (zodiacal)
Sphere 3, 4 (synodic)
Sun (year)

Rotation Start
Sphere 1 (ascension, in degrees)
Sphere 2 (longitude)
Sphere 3, 4
Sun (longitude)

Direction of rotation of Sphere 3
SN
NS

The start point for ascension and longitude should be a point where the equators of Sphere 1 and Sphere 2 intersect.  This will ultimately be in the middle of Aries.


- move moon to normal planet models :)

Schiaparelli/Simplicius fixed
east/west draconitic-zodiacal
west/east dracontic

Mendell
west/east dracontic + zodiacal
east/west draconitic

default angle 5 degrees between Sphere 2 and Sphere 3

Sun
west/east 365
west/east remainder of year
angle 1/2 degree

Different types of years/synodic cycles

Metonic 19 years
       235 synodic months
Hence, 254 zodiacal months
Days in cycle = 6940

Oktaeteris
       8 years
       99 months
Hence,
       107 zodiacal months
Unknown number of days
Set default as 2922 days (365 1/4 days per year)

Callippan (4 times Meton, but days adjusted to get 365 1/4 day year)
76 years
940 months
Hence
       1016 zodiacal months
27759 days

Inputs
Years
Synodic months
days per cycle

Display
days per year
days per synodic month (fraction)
days per zodical month
days per draconitic month

for Sun (all they need see is the sun
angle sphere 1 - 2 default
sphere 2 pop in value here (the period must be > 1 year)
sphere 3 value here will be days per year - sphere 2. (read period for sphere 2)
